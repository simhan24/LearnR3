#Intro stuff section 8
```{r}
2 + 2
```
if you write R setup, it always runs this code first. 
```{r setup}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
library(tidyverse)
library(NHANES)
nhanes_small <- read_csv(here::here("data/nhanes_small.csv"))
```


new code chunk

```{r}
nhanes_small
```

## Table of results

```{r mean-age-bmi-table}
nhanes_small %>%
  filter(!is.na(diabetes), !is.na(education)) %>%
  group_by(diabetes, education) %>%
  summarise(
    mean_age = mean(age, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean_bmi = mean(bmi, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  knitr::kable(caption = "Mean values of age and bmi for education and diabetes status")
```


## prettier table
```{r prettier-table}
#| echo: false
nhanes_small %>%
  filter(!is.na(diabetes), !is.na(education)) %>%
  group_by(diabetes, education) %>%
  summarise(
    mean_age = mean(age, na.rm = TRUE),
    mean_bmi = mean(bmi, na.rm = TRUE)
  ) %>%
  mutate(
    mean_age =
      round(mean_age, digits = 1)
  ) %>%
  mutate(mean_bmi = round(mean_bmi, digits = 1)) %>%
  mutate(education = str_to_sentence(education)) %>%
  rename("Diabetes status" = diabetes, Education = education, "Mean age" = mean_age, "Mean BMI" = mean_bmi) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  knitr::kable(caption = "Mean values of age and bmi for education and diabetes status")
```

##Putting in an IMAGE or figure section 8

When you type out the path of the image, it needs to start from where the Cuarto file is placed. Here the cuarto file QMD is placed in the "doc" folder, so the part starts from there. If you need to back to another folder, you need to write    ..      like the return arrow in the files.
This is cumbersome, so its easier to just place the images and figures in the same path

This image is of the awesome new calorimeter in @fig-get-in-here

#Visualising data (Section 9)

```{r histogram bmi 1}
# Create histogram for bmi
ggplot(nhanes_small, aes(x = bmi)) +
  geom_histogram()
```

```{r histogram bmi 2}
# create histogram for BMI without missing values
ggplot(nhanes_small, aes(x = bmi)) +
  geom_histogram(na.rm = TRUE)
```


```{r histogram with selected or filtered data}
nhanes_small %>%
  filter(bmi <= 60) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = bmi)) +
  geom_histogram(na.rm = TRUE)
```

BMI distribution in NHANES dataset was visualised in @fig-bmi-histo

WHEN YOU MAKE A FIGURE LABEL, ALWAYS HAVE IT START WITH    fig- 

```{r histogram with added labels and caption}
#| fig-cap: "Distribution of BMI."
#| label: fig-bmi-histo

nhanes_small %>%
  filter(bmi <= 60) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = bmi)) +
  geom_histogram(na.rm = TRUE)
```


```{r bar plot to visualise counts}
# create count barplot for education
ggplot(nhanes_small, aes(x = education)) +
  geom_bar()
```
You cannot 

```{r bar plot to visualise, diabetes}
# create count barplot of diabetes
ggplot(nhanes_small, aes(x = diabetes)) +
  geom_bar()
```


```{r bar plot to visualise, diabetes with removing NA values}
nhanes_small %>%
  filter(!is.na(diabetes)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = diabetes)) +
  geom_bar()
```


```{r same as above, but with education}
nhanes_small %>%
  filter(!is.na(education)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = education)) +
  geom_bar()
```

fig-subcap is subcaption for the different bar plots placed side by side. 
layout-ncol defines how many columns placed side by side, in this case 2.



```{r creating 2 bar plots next to each other with subcaptions and captions}
#| label: fig-diabetes-education
#| fig-cap: "Counts of diabetes and education in NHANES"
#| fig-subcap:
#|   - "Number of those with or without diabetes."
#|   - "Number of those with different education level."
#| layout-ncol: 2

nhanes_small %>%
  filter(!is.na(diabetes)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = diabetes)) +
  geom_bar()

nhanes_small %>%
  filter(!is.na(education)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = education)) +
  geom_bar()
```
